<p>I believe that wordpress is the best hosting site to keep tabs and updates on articles. Overall, the user friendliness is much easier than codepen.io because there is no need to learn html for wordpress. Wordpress also has simple pages and posts seperated so one can continue to update on seperate topics and still keep them organized. That said, organization seems to be much easier and in a cleaner format than the other hosting sites. <p>
